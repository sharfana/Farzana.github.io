<p>This Rolls-Royce ‘shooting brake’, or hunting car, reflects the wealth of the nobility.</p>

<p>Gun boxes over the rear mudguards, a roof rack to transport the game and a stag’s head as a radiator mascot – the famous ‘Spirit of Ecstasy’ was to be introduced a year later.

The landowner John Charles Montagu-Douglas-Scott, seventh Duke of Buccleuch and ninth Duke of Queensberry, great-uncle of Lord Montagu of Beaulieu and the descendant of four British monarchs, commissioned this Rolls-Royce in 1910. The bodywork was made by the Scottish coachbuilders to HM The King, Croall & Croall in Kelso.</p>
